Based on Docker’s Moby Project, balena supports container deltas for 10-70x more efficient bandwidth usage, has 3.5x smaller binaries, uses RAM and storage more conservatively, and focuses on atomicity and durability of container pulling.',
        'Having seen IoT devices used in production for tens of millions of hours, we’ve become intimately acquainted with the unique needs of the embedded world. Until recently, we addressed these by either making small modifications to Docker itself or building larger components outside of it, but that approach had reached its limits. Meanwhile, as the Docker binaries have grown in functionality, they have also grown in size, eating away.',

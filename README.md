balenaEngine: Moby-based container engine for IoT
=================================================

<img src="docs/static_files/balena-logo-black.svg" alt="balenaEngine" width="50%" />

## Overview

balenaEngine is a new container engine purpose-built for embedded and IoT use cases
and compatible with Docker containers. Based on Docker’s Moby Project, balenaEngine
supports container deltas for 10-70x more efficient bandwidth usage, has 3x
smaller binaries, uses RAM and storage more conservatively, and focuses on
atomicity and durability of container pulling.

## Features

- __Small footprint__
	- 3.5x smaller than Docker CE, packaged as a single binary
- __Multi-arch support__
	- Available for a wide variety of chipset architectures, supporting everything from tiny IoT devices to large industrial gateways
- __True container deltas__
	- Bandwidth-efficient updates with binary diffs, 10-70x smaller than pulling layers
- __Minimal wear-and-tear__
	- Extract layers as they arrive to prevent excessive writing to disk, protecting your storage from eventual corruption
- __Failure-resistant pulls__
	- Atomic and durable image pulls defend against partial container pulls in the event of power failure
- __Conservative memory use__
	- Prevents page cache thrashing during image pull, so your application runs undisturbed in low-memory situations

## Transitioning from Docker CE

We left out Docker features that we saw as most needed in cloud deployments and
therefore not warranting inclusion in a lightweight IoT-focused container
engine. Specifically, we’ve excluded:

- Docker Swarm
- Cloud logging drivers
- Plugin support
- Overlay networking drivers
- Non-boltdb discovery backends (consul, zookeeper, etcd, etc.)

Unless you depend on one of the features in Docker that balenaEngine omits, using
balenaEngine should be a drop-in replacement.

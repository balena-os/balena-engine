# go-runc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/containerd/go-runc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/containerd/go-runc)


This is a package for consuming the [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) binary in your Go applications.
It tries to expose all the settings and features of the runc CLI.  If there is something missing then add it, its opensource!

This needs runc @ [a9610f2c0](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/a9610f2c0237d2636d05a031ec8659a70e75ffeb)
or greater.

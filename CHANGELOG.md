# v17.13.2

* travis: Use the minimal machine [Robert Günzler]

# v17.13.1
## (2019-02-20)

* vendor: Update runc to include fix for CVE-2019-5736 [Robert Günzler]

# v17.13.0
## (2019-01-31)

* Add cli for tagging delta images [Robert Günzler]
* Allow tagging of image deltas on creation [Robert Günzler]

* Update balenaEngine logo in README.md [Paulo Castro]

# v17.12.1
## (2019-01-14)

* docs: Fix Docker capitalisation in balenaEngine docs [Paulo Castro]

* Project rebranding: `balena` is now known as `balenaEngine` and all the executables now have the `balena-engine` prefix in the file name. This was a result of `resin.io` open sourcing its platform backend and renaming itself `balena.io`. The old `balena.io` landing page will shortly relocate to `balena.io/engine`.
* This release branches off the Docker CE 17.12.0-ce release and brings along all its [new features and bug fixes](https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/docker-ce/#17120-ce-2017-12-27).
* Build environment: Go compiler updated from version 1.9 to 1.10.
* Several additional bug fixes and reliability improvements listed below - the first column is the commit hash prefix.
